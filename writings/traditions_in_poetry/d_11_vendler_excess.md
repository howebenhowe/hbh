two cases for long lines in the past: heroic and ecstatic
Graham starts out with very short lines, every other one indented
Long horizontal lines represent life itself -- I feel at this point that we are getting carried away, projecting more particular meaning into what seems an imprecise choice of line length. Not that the chooser didn't have a particular intent in mind, but that the medium (long/short spectrum) doesn't allow for high specificity of intent--like how we think to confine testimony to yes/know answers in order to limit communicating intentions
numbering lines suddenly makes each one a freeze-frame
in self-portrait poetry, the freeze-frame effect can be mapped to the painter's glances from mirror to canvas, the beat between experience and creation -- cool how that gives an accounting of time that is recreated at the moment of reading. Typically, time can exist within the poem (as in a poem that describes a span of time) but I don't know of other poems that offer the experience of the poem's creation itself.
Jeeze, AP, I hope you're not reading through 16
