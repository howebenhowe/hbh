# overflow

Poets cause meaning to overflow the vessels of familiar language. With meaning on the loose, it's up to us to participate in catching it: the chase is on. Schklovsky pointed out the poet's task of defamiliarizing images so they might register poignantly. Scarry showed us how beauty occurs always in the particular. Eagan synthesized the Romantics' idea that vividness of experience decays with time, and how imagination "hopes to recapture the childhood purity of experience, a purity not yet diluted by repetition and made familiar." Though the address different facets (image, beauty, and imagination respectively) they all develop their conversations around the idea that there is a form of participatory emotional and intellectual impression we can experience through art that contrasts the automatic processing we depend on to get through the day. As poets deal in language, it's words they rupture to bring us into communion.

Words through their common daily commerce become well established, resolving more and more into a fixed and expected meaning. The word 'disaster' is easy to apply to a muffin-bake gone awry; the common meaning today has been worn smooth by repeated basic application. Its former meaning of 'star-crossed' is an etymological factoid I relish, but absent when I'm bemoaning lost muffins. This kind of meaning simplification helps streamline common communication by reducing how much the listening party has to process. Typical language is regular enough that we can set up fully automatic customer service call centers. Robert Hass gestures to the inadequacy of words in Meditation at Lagunitas when he writes "a word is an elegy to what it signifies." In that poem, he assembles a treasure box of memories, and then returns to repetions of 'blackberry'. By the end, the word has been associated with a far greater scope of experience than a purple fruit.

The poets tools--sound devices, figures of speech, rhythm and others--force us to regard words and phrases beyond their basic semantic function. Taking the poem History is a Burning Chariot by Charles Wright (printed below), we can find a spread of these tools in action. In the first line, Wright combines incompatible nouns and adjectives by calling an 'evening' 'chained'. The creek 'sniddles', which is either an obscure dialectical English word (per Merriam Webster), a vulgar slur (per Urban Dictionary) or an invented onomatopoeic verb that Wright trusts us to assign meaning to. The clouds are anthropomorphised as they sit majestic in their chairs, but their majesty is undermined by the following line, where they are doing their nails--the frivolous follow up to the regal introduction makes us less certain that Wright's words will conform to standard seriousness. A few lines later, Wright abruptly transitions to direct, recasting the first six lines as the condition of the following plea. We don't know until the second-to-last line that the speaker is addressing God, and so Wright creates two revelations of the speaker's audience, each of which comes without introduction and prompts us to reconsider the speaker's purpose with their words. The speaker omits punctuationy when asking and answering their own questions as in "Have I said them before, I have,/have I said them the same way, I have," and most notably across the lines "Will i say them again, who knows/What darkness snips at our hearts." The two previous lines having established question-answer pairs of comparable length, we are primed to read "who knows" as answer, but it's also elligible as the first two words of a clause "Who knows what darkness snips at our hearts?". Wright sets our expectation for typical question-answer, and then breaks the expectation leaving us on alert for when we might be mid question or mid answer. Lastly, he references the ballad Sir Patrick Spens, which breaks the boundary on the content we might project onto a poem by

The ambiguity from the words "Will i say them again, who knows/What darkness snips at our hearts" is detrimental to the arranging of reason and well-ordered thought in pursuit of truth. Because it is unstable and can't resolve neatly to a simple universally understood meaning, it only survives as meaning-containing language as long as we maintain it by participating in the experience. The ruptured language depends on our input, and our input brings about the mutual life-affirmation Scarry paints as the fulcrum point in the beauty-begetting-justice chain of effect. 

I read Plato's Republic when I started at Columbia five years ago. I was delighted with his Lincoln Log simplistic approach to assembling logical structures. There followed a slew of rationalism-prizing thinkers who introduced layers of sophistication over Plato's ideas, and who pounded away at language, forming discrete blocks of meaning from which to build their -ism cathedrals. That isn't a balanced diet; it pretends that meaning can be well represented when well ordered, and disregards the other side of language that only lives wild, that requires the imaginative and animating participation of the audience. A few weeks ago, I was sitting in the Google Store in downtown Manhattan waiting for three hours while a technician replaced my phone's touchscreen. To pass the time, I opened Aimé Césaire's Notebook of a Return to the Native Land. I read:

"And above all, my body as well as my soul, beware of assuming the sterile attitude of a spectator, for life is not a spectacle, a sea of miseries is not a proscenium, a man screaming is not a dancing bear..."

Reading those words in that store in this city, briefly separated from my favorite anesthetic, I laughed and I trembled.

History is a Burning Chariot
by Charles Wright

It is a good-looking evening, stomped and chained.
The clouds sit like majesties in their blue chairs,
    As though doing their nails
The creek, tripartite and unreserved, sniddles along
Under its bald and blown-down bridges.
It is a grace to be a watcher on such a scene.
So balance me with these words -
Have I said them before, I have,
    have I said them the same way, I have,
Will i say them again, who knows
        What darkness snips at our hearts.

I've done the full moon, I've done the half moon and the
	quarter moon.
I've even done the Patrick Spens moon
As seen by one of his drowned sailors.
Tonight is the full moon again, and I won't watch it.
These things have a starting place, and they have an ending.
Render the balance, Lord.
         Send it back up to the beginning.
