## Go to the Limits of your Longing
God speaks to each of us as he makes us,
then walks with us silently out of the night.

These are the words we dimly hear:

You, sent out beyond your recall,
go to the limits of your longing.
Embody me.

Flare up like a flame
and make big shadows I can move in.

Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.
Just keep going. No feeling is final.
Don't let yourself lose me.

Nearby is the country they call life.
You will know it by its seriousness.

Give me your hand.

After Rainer Maria Rilke - Go to the Limits of your Longing

"I'm expecting a package that's quite delayed"
When the wind hits you it slows you down.
At first I fight to move faster, still.
I apply more pressure with my legs.
I remain in an automatic state.
I press my effort against the obstacle.
I press my lungs into the wind.
But what of it?
That's when I double back into the music.
That's when I return to my body.
I feel the sharp stings of snow pellets driven into my naked scalp.
I feel the cold stripping my legs.
I feel the shifting of weight from left to right.
And then, the movement forward. Then the grace.
No idea if I was moving fast or slow, but then
that wasn't exactly the point of finding grace.

##

I met someone who activated me.
Who brought me great treasures.
Bathed me in treasures
Briskly, a vigorous scrubbing down

Tingle, prickle, a bit raw, step out
Those reluctant feelings, that would prefer to remain sequestered and paved over by highways of throughput[!] a good march. Feelings like little crabs that are so intent on hiding for safety
Reaching back out

The sick revulsion, with self, with world beyond, with accuser, with surroundings. A propagating bitterness. Then, so soon, the smug satisfaction of being good, of doing good, tainted still with so much desire for self. A propagating bitterness?

Stirring, activating, launching. Ing Ing Ing Ing.
Moments to draw from:
Lunging up the staircase, having caught sight of ap while she waits for the elevator, knowing that we'll intersect at the top.
A stroke, a spark catching, hem and haw to enter the building, but then the terrible good fortune of being happened upon.
