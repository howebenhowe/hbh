# the ultimate unreliable narrator
Recent research has made vast new strides into a complete understanding of the older sibling's brain. For the greatest part of history, we have thought that the material construction of human brains differed on the basis of genetics and physical interference in the form of malnutrition, but that psychology and physiognomy were domains discrete from one another. Thanks to the exceptional findings of Hoffbauer and Yoshimura, a more complete picture is coming into focus. When the cerebellum reaches primary interstitial peristalsis, usually after the second or third birthday, it begins to augment and priviledge those synaptic throughput vectors which correspond most closely to reflective capability. What Hoffbauer suggested and Yoshimura later corroborated was that this universal constant of development was modulated in families with more than one child to the detriment of the older sibling. They proved that, with an R^2 value of .962, the presence of a younger sibling correlated with a 70% dampening on the older sibling's activity along those neural pathways most associated with self-reflectivity and empathy. While that finding has been revelatory, a boon to the collective effort to understand and hopefully one day treat the most acutely afflicted of our society, Hoffbauer and Yoshimura stopped short of some of the grimmer realities consequent to their discovery; they neglected to enforce the net-zero axiom of neural activity, which demonstrates holds that dampening action in one region necessitates a commesurate increase in another: an equal and opposite reaction (see: Darwin). Unfortunately, the 'opposite' reaction doesn't steer the developing mind toward a social boon as compensation--the enforcers of physics do not truck with morality--but rather sees the unspent energy applied where it is most convenient from a biophysics perspective. It is the sad but inevitable conclusion of this paper that the young, developing older-siblings minds of our society are both stunted in their development of the capability for self-reflection while they are accelerated in their development of bullishness, righteousness, and general wont-share-the-TV-remote (-ness).


# flaneur (with an 'a'-hat)
This lock is bitter. I miss the reassuring sound of the lock of my childhood home's front door. The tarnished brass door handle is solid and cold in my memory. The latch slid smooth, and the bolt delivered with a confirming thud. The lock before me has no familiar wear. It is milled--or maybe stamped--stainless steel. It is cursed to gleam forever, sterile to the caresses of my hands. Twisting the key, the latch snaps away from the housing, and I step into my kitchen. Jordan working at the kitchen table and the cool late morning sun cuts her features into sharp relief; the pale skin of her window-side cheeks is almost incandescent, her left all shadow. Prince, as a cartoon, glowers from her coffee mug. With the severe angle of the sun, our dark and varnished table plays reflecting pool. Prince below looks as haughty.
It's much warmer inside, but I can still feel a chill breeze pulling in. Jordan has left both of the kitchen a few inches short of closed up, and air from the street is slipping down the hallway out the open window in Jordan's room. The plant nearest the window--a palm--shivers a little as the breeze teases its fronds. The tips of the fronds are burnt from either too much sun or too much water. I fill a cup of coffee before heading to my room. The pot is so full when I tip it into my cup that I'm not surprised when the watery top layer of coffee runs messily down the side of the pot onto the counter. Sighs of opera from the kitchen radio follow me the length of the hallway, until they hand me off to the smaller radio playing from Jordan's bedroom. The hallway guides me north, away from sunny street, toward NCY grotto back yard. My bedroom door is tall, perhaps eigh feet. All the way around its extended perimeter, it fits snug to its frame, so snug that when I push to open it I can feel the room's pneumatic resistance, a reluctant cushion that complies under my gentle insistent pressing.

An dog stirs from where it has been sleeping in a ditch on the side of a dirt road. It lifts its head, rises to an upright sit, then stands fully alert. Its ears are perked up, though its foggy eyes drift. From down the road, a group of children are walking toward the dog, kicking a basketball back and forth between them. The ball stirs up puffs of dust as it rolls. The dog waits, still, until they arrive. The walk by, continuing to laugh and jostle one another. The dog hops stiffly up to the road and follows. After a few more passes, the ball gets past the smallest boy and he has to chase after it. The group stops while he fetches the ball. They all see the dog. One of the boys tries to whistle, but another one lightly punches him in the stomach and they laugh. Another boy claps and calls to the dog. The small boy pulls a plastic baggie out of his pocket and fishes out a couple bits of sliced salami. He tosses them to the dog. The dog shuffles forward, sniffing, and then eats the meat. The dog must make a superabundance fo mouth movements, because the dog doesn't have very many teeth. The small boy beckons, the rest of the boys start walking, and the dog follows behind.

There is a railroad trestle spanning a wide river. The trestle is stained in the places the paint has cracked. The river's surface is wrinkled by current, and flickers in midday sun. The boys arrive down the tracks to the trestle. The dog is following them. One of the boys is carrying the ball. Another boy bends over, picks up a rock from the railroad bed, and throws it at the river. The rock falls short. The biggest boy tousles the thrower's hair as he steps past him onto a walkway along the side of the trestle. The rest of the boys follow until only the dog is standing on firm ground. The dog shuffles slowly on its paws. The smallest boy turns around calls out. The dog shuffles a little more, but sits down. The smallest boy calls again, dropping to a squat and gently clapping his hands. The dog, haltingly, rises to its feet and scampers along the walkway grating. The smallest boy turns back toward the other boys and jogs to catch up.

Midway along the bridge, while the dog is catching up to the boys, a gull swoops down toward its nest among the support beams. It passes close in front of the dog, and the dog hops reflexively to the side. The dog falls. The dog's legs kick as it tumbles through open air. The dog is a very small by the time it reaches the water; the splash soothes fast.

The smallest boy stops walking and turns around. He scowls and speaks to the other boys, who also turn around. The smallest boy leans starts running back along the trestle. Except for the one carrying the ball, the rest of the boys lean over the guardrail to peer down. The smallest boy races down to the riverbank. One of the boys on the bridge yells and points at the river, but the biggest boy knocks away the pointing finger. The boys on the bridge continue staring. The smallest boy walks back and forth and back and forth along the shore. Eventually, he sits down.

Fella on train. Midday, Friday. Lime green bucket hat with waffle/corduroy patterns. Tan many-pocket jacket like lightweight hunting coat, but softer for its city habitat. Same color timberland boots, laces loose, maroon socks quickly swallowed by tight trousers. Few ruptures at in each leg. Moss dusty patches of mustard-color stains the thighs. Button-up shirt printed like a collage of newsprint. No full stories and the [...] inside the jacket. Lean and angular face with odd glances about the car but most attention leashed to phone, phone leashed to charger tucked between legs. Leans forward now elbows on thighs - which is more [...] Wrists protrude for the curling forward [...] pink, white, green bead bracelet. Letters peaking out, faded and camoflauged against caramel-colored skin. Visible bone of jaw, anchor of hair around mouth and the total relaxation of flaccid muscles of a [...] in his hand, a plastic-wrapped package, a pair of red meat slabs. Tattoos only on one side (r) use stains on timbs. Spreads [...] bent over fussing with laces and tongue. Wets frayed lace to feed it htrough eyelet, folds tongue over toward the tip of the boot, lays feet splayed heels in and toes leaning out and bracing. when I get off, he is redied, and his phone and charger are resting on the meat in the seat adjacent.

As soon as the train doors cracked open, Vee was through. He went up the stairs, up to the street. Two blocks east, he arrived to the apartment. His girlfriend opened the door.
"What happened to your pants?"
Vee looked down. Splattered mud spotted his left leg.
"Passing car, probably." he said. Vee stepped inside. He set the plastic-wrapped beef on the counter. It had warmed up, about the same temperature as outside.
"We should cook that quick." Vee said. He kicked off his boots, but one wouldn't release his toe. It made a racket with the closet door where it fell.
"Jeesus! Do you mind?" she asked. Vee snorted. He sat. A few shreds of fake leather uphostery fluttered to the ground. Vee pulled out his phone and flipped through it. He scratched himself.
"Oh, that's what you mean by 'we should cook', hmm?" she said."Babe, ah hell with it." Vee said, not breaking from his phone.
"No, hell with you!" she shot back. "Mud in my damn house! Those big boots! I told you to pick up food, Vee. What the hell is this?" she said. She lifted one side of the meat pack and dropped it. It slapped the counter.
"Meat." Vee said.
"Get out." she said, "You're bing a shit and you know it. God, Vee, you can be so petulant. Go!"
Vee looked up from his phone and sighed. He unslouched and stood. He walked to entry and stuffed his feet back in his boots. The tongues drooped over the laces. He adjusted his had. It was lime green corduroy. He smirked at himself then stepped outside.
It was cold outside, and raining a little. Vee hunched up his shoulders. He stuffed his hands into his armpits and started down the block. At the corner, neon beckoned him inside. Vee smiled. He entered.
