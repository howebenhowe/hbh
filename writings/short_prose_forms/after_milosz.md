Aspen P

I must think suddenly of matters too difficult for a bear of little brain. I have never asked myself what lies beyond the place where we live, I and Rabbit, Piglet and Eeyore, with our friend Christopher Robin. That is, we continued to live here, and nothing changed, and I just ate my little something. Only Christopher Robin left for a moment.
Owl says that immediately beyond our garden Time begins, and that it is an awfully deep well. If you fall in it, you go down and down, very quickly, and no one knows what happens to you next. I was a bit worried about Christopher Robin falling in, but he came back and then I asked him about the well. "Old bear," he answered. "I was in it and I was falling and I was changing as I fell. My legs became long, I was a big person, I wore trousers down to the ground, I had a gray beard, then I grew old, hunched, and I walked with a cane, and then I died. It was probably just a dream, and it was quite unreal. The only real thing was you, old bear, and our shared fun. Now I won't go anywhere, even if I'm called for an afternoon snack."

language is simple, a couple flourishes beyond a child's usage ('immediately beyond...')
A few physical points of focus that communicate the essence
+ the well is time, it has physical properties intelligible to a child and symbolic meaning for adult reader
+ simple action language with childlike repetition for emphasis (down and down)
+ couple characters referenced, but only in passing
+ first paragraph sets narrator, second paragraph introduces Christopher Robin

## my agenda
+ hilight the preciousness of childhood and childhood home
+ show the connection across time (playing together, shaping attitude)
+ show the separation across time (transition perspective, I'm now older)

After Czeszlaw Milosz

A boy called 'hello' from his porch while I was walking by, nearly home, right at the top of the hill. His house is just like mine with a cherry tree on the side. "I'm Aspen", he told me, and did I want to see the goldfish in the rain barrel?

We bounced on his trampoline and collected the souring apples from where they had fallen into the garden. My shorts caught here and there on bush bristles, it got cooler, and his mom called him for an afternoon snack.

I didn't want that day to end. Later, Aspen's grandfather would teach him how to clamp a vice and pull the saw straight, steady. The lesson is the same one I got, only the voice is a bit croakier now.

I have to head back, so I left Aspen to eat his little something. I went home up that porch and put on my trousers that go all the way to the ground. I put on a hairy face and body that feels its own weight.

Perhaps tomorrow we can drink chocolate milk barefoot on the porch or build legos. Maybe next year we'll vault puddles down in the ravine. Maybe tonight I'll read you a story.
