# christopher robin
I must think suddenly of matters too difficult for a bear of little brain. I have never asked myself what lies beyond the place where we live, I and Rabbit, Piglet and Eeyore, with our friend Christopher Robin. That is, we continued to live here, and nothing changed, and I just ate my little something. Only Christopher Robin left for a moment.
Owl says that immediately beyond our garden Time begins, and that it is an awfully deep well. If you fall in it, you go down and down, very quickly, and no one knows what happens to you next. I was a bit worried about Christopher Robin falling in, but he came back and then I asked him about the well. "Old bear," he answered. "I was in it and I was falling and I was changing as I fell. My legs became long, I was a big person, I wore trousers down to the ground, I had a gray beard, then I grew old, hunched, and I walked with a cane, and then I died. It was probably just a dream, and it was quite unreal. The only real thing was you, old bear, and our shared fun. Now I won't go anywhere, even if I'm called for an afternoon snack."

# practices
language is simple, a couple flourishes beyond a child's usage ('immediately beyond...')
A few physical points of focus that communicate the essence
+ the well is time, it has physical properties intelligible to a child and symbolic meaning for adult reader
+ simple action language with childlike repetition for emphasis (down and down)
+ couple characters referenced, but only in passing
+ first paragraph sets narrator, second paragraph introduces Christopher Robin

# my agenda
+ hilight the preciousness of childhood and childhood home
+ show the connection across time (playing together, shaping attitude)
+ show the separation across time (transition perspective, I'm now older)

# Visiting
After Czeszlaw Milosz

The boy called 'hello' to me from his porch while I was walking by, nearly home, right at the top of the hill. His house is just like mine with the same cherry tree on the side. "I'm seven", he told me, and did I want to see the goldfish in the rain barrel?

We bounced on his trampoline and collected the souring apples from where they had fallen into the garden. My shorts caught here and there on bush bristles. We played in Kick the Can with the neighbors until he scraped his knee. It got cooler, and his mom called him for an afternoon snack.

I didn't want that day to end. Later, he would learn from his grandfather how to clamp a vice and pull the saw straight, steady. The lesson hasn't changed since it was taught to me, only the voice is a bit croakier now.

But I have to head back, so I left the boy to eat his little something. I went home up that porch and put on my trousers that go all the way to the ground. I put on a hairy face and body that feels its own weight.

Perhaps tomorrow we can drink chocolate milk barefoot on the porch or build legos. Maybe next year we'll vault puddles down in the ravine. Maybe tonight I'll read you a story.

# notes from my notebook, snatched from the jaws of illegibility

+ the last line survives: gave understanding
+ [folks were] on board with Milne
+ we like the goldfish + transition with it
+ liked lapse time
+ 2 for the goldfish quote-breaks
+ brevity [a f?] -> emphasizing time compression 
+ "up that porch" -> lynchpin line -> brings home time travel aspect

## negative disorientation:
+ Get the word 'nephew' in there, maybe the title? // I settled on not explicitly naming the nephew-uncle relationship; I'd rather let the reader decide if the boy is the same person as the narrator, because the similarity between nephew and uncle's similarity is much the point, so the feels important to maintain. Instead, I aim to relieve the reader of the impulse to sort out a family tree by making the same-grandpa and same-house pieces more obvious.
+ 'called' from first line
+ Beat missing somewhere to bridge to "didn't want" -> bottom 2nd 3rd paragraphs
+ distance introduced by "same one" feels physical
+ who is this man? // hopefully clarified by more explicit 
+ Caleb: not so important who/how related; use more detail to ground the reader
+ "Face and Body" orient the reader
+ don't want that day to end forward it to one moment -> how to appre[unintelligible] time // bummer having inconsistent handwriting
+ nix 'grandfather' ? make it 'my grandfather'? // no, but I'll reorder the sentence to downplay resolving that confusion from "the boy's grandfather would teach" to "the would later learn from his grandfather" -> the clauses of less importance
+ How to support that everyone besides boy has aged? // I dunno, and from where I stand weeks out from this thought, I don't think I care
+ why do I carve out the separation when I do? My classmates encourage me to draw out the development of relationship with Aspen before separating them in time // roger, wilco
+ "his" (grandfather mother) begs the father question // hoping other family-tree-minimizing changes have taken care of this
+ drop name, give familiarity // done
+ advance of relationship works for caleb -> progress from introduction to shared history its metaphor
+ include more of narrator's connection to grandfather + mother
+ apply flux-cont (?) more liberally to exaggerate the isolation of the boy // I wish I knew what I had meant to capture in this mysterious wisdom
