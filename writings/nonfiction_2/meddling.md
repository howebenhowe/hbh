Madeline started a Zoom-based writing club, and invited me to join. The arrangement was straightforward: we were to meet every other week having read two pieces in the time between. One of those pieces would be a published piece, identified by someone in the group as meriting our collective attention. The other piece, written by one of us. It was fun, if occasionally intimidating. I hadn't written for others to read without the prodding of a teacher or an application compelling me. Here, I wrote because I had decided--with Madeline's encouragement--that I would like to.

The group grew to include several of Madeline's and my own former high school classmates, Madeline's parents, some college friends, and eventually Madeline's boyfriend Geo. He introduced himself as a poet, and introduced himself as a poet, as a poet. He's a poet. I am no poet, and hardly a reader of poetry. Nonetheless in the spirit that led me to the group initially, I gamely approached the poetry that the group engaged from time to time. At the end of every session of response and feedback to poetry, Geo would find a way to alert the rest of us in the group to our shortcomings as readers. He would tell us we were looking for the wrong things in the poem, providing feedback not on the essence of the poetry, but the mere words. Geo was there to guide us to what matters, to the true, deep, essential feelings. What star-crossed circumstance! We had managed through sheer bum luck to assemble a group uniformly lacking the apparatus for receiving feelings from poetry.

Some months into participating in Madeline's writing group, I solicited my mom interest in our writing group. She is keen and coarse; she'll cut into the weaknesses in what she reads and in the same breath break to vulgar humor. Viz: 

Me to ma: "Have you read Portnoy's Complaint?"
Ma to me: "Penis, penis, penis, I hate my mother, penis penis penis.
You mean that one?"

This is a good person to have in your writing club, so with Madeline's blessing I roped her in. It did not take her long to work up her own estimations of everyone in the writing group, and I wasn't about to miss the opportunity to benefit from her acerbity. Besides, I yearned for closeness with my family as medicine to pandemic isolation, even if that closeness came as petty sidebar commentary. Off camera, we kept up a steady exchange of textual snickers and eye-rolls.

Late in April, Geo's number was up; it was his turn to submit to the group.

Maybe the warming, sticky New Orleans weather had shortened my temper--or maybe any other polite and untrue substitute circumstance--or maybe I had grown frustrated in the honest way of folks who have had enough. As we each of us settled in to our sofas and desk chairs around the country, I made a silent, text-message vow to my mom:

"If this guy tells us how to read poetry again, I'm giving him both barrels."

In-keeping with the structure of our meetings, the poet (poet) kept his peace until the end of our workshopping session, when Madeline asked him if he had any further questions for the group about his piece. Geo thought for a moment, then asked if we had thought to read the poem instead from the perspective of...I have mislaid the rest in memory. My blood was began to churn in my ears, a roar of fight-or-flight chemicals overtook my senses. For this conflict-allergic younger brother self-styled "cerebral" Seattleite, this wasn't the overture to rebuke; it was an emotional eclipse, a confrontation with unknowable stakes. Internally, I was huffing. I checked if the escape hatch was operable:

"Geo, I just want to be sure I understand. Are you telling us how to read poetry?"

No no, he answered, just, maybe you should think about it this other way. I gave him both of the barrels.

"When you submitted your poem to the group, we took time to read it and collect our thoughts about it. I offered in good faith the best feedback I could. When you tell the group that all our feedback is misplaced because we are not reading poetry correctly, not capable of understanding your work the way that only you seem to, I find it very fucking insulting."

Then it was quiet. My phone buzzed: "Atta boy." Thanks, ma. Not long after, I ducked out.

I received an apology text message from Geo a couple days later. Strictly speaking, it was conditionally an apology, the kind with an 'if' right after the part that goes "I'm sorry". He let me know that I had mistaken a joke for something serious, I had misunderstood. He offered to talk. Searching myself, I didn't discover any desire to fix my understanding, so I deleted the message and put it out of my mind.

By January I had moved back to New York City and was enjoying falafel from Mamoun's Falafel in Washington Square Park. It was cold, so for the sake of my fingers I ate quickly. Madeline, on the opposite side of the concrete chess table, was eating in tiny increments, just as she always has. We blew through the family, school, and work updates, and arrived to the exciting moment in a reunion where you steer into the new episode. The excitement was palpably tempered, though. Tempered by the same lingering sogginess had impinged on our first reunion after I moved back, and the fistful of phone chats we'd had before that. Madeline finished her falafel and told me I have to make nice with Geo. She explained that spending time with me brings discomfort to her relationship as long as there is unresolved conflict. She told me I would need to apologize.

Where do forgiving and forgetting meet? I had bristled in a writing group at a turn of phrase. Though at the time I had blazed with a gladiator's ferocity, it's really no great shakes one way or the other. Anyway, I'm sure you get what I mean.

groans from title + first line, liked anticipation
enjoyed brevity of conclusion of action with Geo, liked it as one-and-done interaction w/G
story felt bigger than me + g, wanted more on M + ma, dynaices of those relationships, curiosity stirred re. my instincts towards madeline?
wanted more flesh to the rels.
wanted more sense of m + g's presonalities (incl. persona background, odds and ends of dialog?)
rlm likes the omissions, omitting g's full comment, omits my own anger process
likes how that leaves blanks, raises questions over who/why blanks should be filled, self-similarity between form and substance
ending sets up relationship between reader and writer, hints at the possibility that I(ben) might turn Geo at the end of the workshop
make the narrator more of an everyman thrust into petty situation
tone none too whingey, enough of a redemption arc that I tell geo off
mjs wants more gossipiness, experiment with abandon! Get bitchy! That, too, would serve the redemption agenda.
liked dialogue -> how to incl more when you are trying to only tell the truth?
mr neapo(sp?) wants speciment of Geo flavored feedback, examples of how he acts and behaves, it's zoom which amps up the awkward and gossip as zoom informs it
liked ma-me me-ma, electronic overlay throughout. Incl. other tex faff, zoom chatter type parallel dialog.
Mr. neape wants more on the other members of the room. Margo? M's folks? eyerolls and groans?
ML points out that there's ambiguity as to who induced the eyerolls -- was the narrator hte asshole? AITA?
this was an experiment in dramatizing as much as anything else
KR: favorite part is humor + flare, wants more of that. Lean into indulged pettiness. Go petty if true, (do I care iftrue? it's drama, tell it best?)
add more about group dynamic, wants description of geo
list out what info is offered on Geo: poet, M's boyfriend ...?
davy imagines the pink sweatshirt and mac demarco
RL likes that we get Madeline but not more than her name up front, finds it fitting to the Zoom environment (offer a short visual on a couple characters?)
include matter of Geo after, which would give more context to M and G characters
Nhi likes the ending-at-the-beginning approach
Give cause for interest up front, right fro the jump
without artist statement, not much evidence that the narrator is questionable. If I want the question of the narrator's cleanliness to be in question, gonna need more.
the nastier you write the narrator, the more likeable
there's evidence that narrator would be sensitive about right to be in a writer's space (stemming from first bit wrt. being new to the writing group), shows up in that narrator shows disdain for Geo
RLM: conflict allergic assertion is suss; followed immediately by conflict. Calls narrator into question; should give more illustration that 
ML: had to reread the conflict-aversion sentence a couple times for it to land, big bummer since it's a climax; confused for a sec if the conflict averse person is narrator or Geo -- clarify it but keep it spicy. It slowed him down when he wanted to most move steadily through.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ How to address a need for dialog without a perfect memory. So too with body language, etc? Am I not supposed to ask about that?
+ top knot + beard
+ thomas bernhardt (?) writer uses nasty characters full of venom -- who else to think of? Iago, etc?
