# About

I'm a writer and programmer in NYC. I live and coordinate with a big household, perhaps you've come to one of our Fried Chicken Sundays. Perhaps you haven't yet, but you would like to? Shoot me an email at <howebenhowe@gmail.com>. Come ride a bike with me, or just say hello. If you know me, I trust you know these aren't empty offers. If you don't know me, know these aren't empty offers.
